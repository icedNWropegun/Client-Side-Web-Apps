3.) Forkify: This is a HUGE real-world food sharing application. It boasts modern features of JavaScript like ES6 Modules, Async, Await, and Array iterator methods. The Forkify app leverages several web API's for functionality and incorporates well established architecture patterns like MVC and the publisher/ subscriber pattern. Object oriented programming and prototypal inheritance gives our presentation logic a maintainable structure and prevents private class methods from being accessible within the public API. Software applications such as NPM, Parcel, and Babel were employed to configure plugins, utility libraries, compile scss, and polyfilling / transpiling for browser compatability.

List of Web API's employed in the Forkify app: Fetch for GET and POST, Window.history for manipulating the browser session history, and Window.localStorage to persist data over time.
